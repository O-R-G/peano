+ add turtle module for drawing peano curve
+ add command line args to spawn windows with settings
+ work out error in drawing for odd powers of 3 which compresses x values
+ revise input names, Detail -> Points (3^n), Precision -> Order, Display
+ fix Precision/Order 
+ add recursive erase of previous curve
- add ranges to input values (?)
- adjust speed based combo of power of 3 and precision
+ if precision = 0, then skip every other draw loop
  (this is b/c peano function is not 1:1, but rather also 1:2 (and 1:4)!)
+ hide turtle, which speeds 
+ add class for number to check for 1, 2, or 4 coordinate pairs for any T on the number line
- draw T derived (4 values from Number) as red points or maybe +'s
