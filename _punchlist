+ add turtle module for drawing peano curve
+ add command line args to spawn windows with settings
+ work out error in drawing for odd powers of 3 which compresses x values
+ revise input names, Detail -> Points (3^n), Precision -> Order, Display
+ fix Precision/Order 
+ add recursive erase of previous curve
- add ranges to input values (?)
- adjust speed based combo of power of 3 and precision
+ if precision = 0, then skip every other draw loop
  (this is b/c peano function is not 1:1, but rather also 1:2 (and 1:4)!)
+ hide turtle, which speeds 
+ add class for number to check for 1, 2, or 4 coordinate pairs for any T on the number line
+ calculate T values from input coordinate points X, X', Y, Y'
- draw T derived (4 values from Number) as red points or maybe +'s
- add keyboard pause, rewind, step back / forward
/ add sound (as per philip)
  map x value to pitch of 'instrument' #1 (timbre?)
  map y value to pitch of 'instrument' #2 (timbre?)
  play both simultaneously as a chord
  maybe do this without drawing as drawing is too slow
  one whole mapping of T should be of the same duration
  so that tempo gets faster and faster as the curve becomes denser
  or maybe just sine waves using pysine library or pysinewave library
  https://pypi.org/project/pysinewave/
+ install pysinewave (editable) with > pip install -e . in local git repo 
  because  pip version does not work with channels. added to this repo as 
  a submodule
+ add ability to output animation and create sprite for animation
- clean up this logic with a flag to turn on and off export as eps
